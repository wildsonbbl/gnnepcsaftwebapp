        GNNePCSAFT is a project focused in the use of graph neural networks to
        estimate pure-component parameters of the Equation of State ePC-SAFT.
        The motivation of this work is to be able to use a robust Equation of
        State without prior need of experimental data. Equations of State are
        important to calculate thermodynamic properties, and are pre-requisite
        in process simulators.

        Currently, the model takes in account only the hard-chain and dispersive
        terms of ePC-SAFT. Future work on associative, polar and ionic terms are
        being considered. Code is being developed mainly in Pytorch (PYG).
