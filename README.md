## Project Overview: Smart Thermodynamic Modeling with Graph Neural Networks

Embark on a cutting-edge journey with our project that harnesses the power of graph neural networks to estimate pure-component parameters of the state-of-the-art Equation of State, ePC-SAFT. We aim to empower users to leverage this robust equation without the need for prior experimental data, revolutionizing the calculation of thermodynamic properties and enhancing process simulations.

### Current Capabilities

Focus on the hard-chain, dispersive, and associative terms of ePC-SAFT.

Robust, accurate, and ready to streamline your thermodynamic calculations.

### Future Aspirations

Ongoing research on incorporating polar and ionic terms for comprehensive modeling.

Pioneering advancements to make ePC-SAFT more versatile and applicable across various domains.
