## Project Overview: Smart Thermodynamic Modeling with Graph Neural Networks

Embark on a cutting-edge journey with our project that harnesses the power of Graph Neural Network ([GNN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_neural_network)) to estimate pure-component parameters of the state-of-the-art Equation of State, [ePC-SAFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC-SAFT). We aim to empower users to leverage this robust equation without the need for prior experimental data, revolutionizing the calculation of thermodynamic properties and enhancing process simulations. [FeOS](https://github.com/feos-org/feos) is used for the PC-SAFT calculations. The estimated parameters can be used in [DWSIM](https://dwsim.org/) and [Aspen HYSYS](https://www.aspentech.com/en/products/engineering/aspen-hysys) process simulators.

### Current Capabilities

Focus on the hard-chain, dispersive, and associative terms of ePC-SAFT.

Robust, accurate, and ready to streamline your thermodynamic calculations.

### Future Aspirations

Ongoing research on incorporating polar and ionic terms for comprehensive modeling.

Pioneering advancements to make ePC-SAFT more versatile and applicable across various domains.
